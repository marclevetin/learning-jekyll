My first job after graduating from [Launch Academy](https://www.launchacademy.com)
is as a teaching assistant at [UNH](https://codingbootcamp.unh.edu/).

I have a little bit of teaching experience in other areas of life.  While there are
definitely transferable skills between teaching someone to dance for their wedding and
teaching someone to code for the first time, there are some noticeable differences.
Most importantly are the soft skills that come along for the ride.

Huh?

**When someone learns to dance**, there are a lot of tactical things to learn: the patterns,
music fundamentals, how to move your body, and so on.  Watch an episode of Dancing With The Starts
and you'll get the idea.  **Learning to code** has analogous activities: syntax, vocabulary, and how
to split up a big problem into little problems.

Comparatively speaking, that's all "easy."

The harder bit is learning the psychology behind the activity.  **In dance**, you have to learn to think
about personal space and proper behavior inside that bubble.  **Coding** redefines concepts like "success" and what's considered "good."  There are lots of ways to produce the same result, and technologies come and go over time.

Overall, I dig the challenge of motivating the students to succeed.  And it's fun to try to apply old techniques to new situations.

Here's hoping it goes well.
