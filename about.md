Howdy.  Thanks for checking out my site.

I've worn a lot of hats over the years.  I've been a bassoonist, dance teacher, training consultant, property management bookkeeping expert, and product manager.  The latest hat is software developer.  At least, that's the plan.

This site documents the things I learn along the way.
